        <p className='indented'>I would love it if we could change systems, not tell people that they have to change their behavior, so that no matter what they do, there are no negative side effects. For example, no matter how you live, no emissions are made because things are electrified and the electricity is clean (there is more to setting up our systems and infrastructure to be zero-emission). Or, no matter how much meat people eat, there is no animal suffering or environmental degradation because the meat was lab-grown in a bioreactor powered by renewable energy.</p>
        <div className="indented">I think this is the solution we should strive for.</div>
