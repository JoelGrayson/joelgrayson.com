# About
Used for API requests that cannot be done on Next.js and require using Express.js, such as for using Puppeteer, Google API, and EJS.


# Testing on Mac
To test locally on Mac, run `./test_on_mac.sh`. The way it works is it excludes puppeteer from the package.json and installs the dependencies without it.
